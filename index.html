      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p class="lead mb-5">
        Hi, I am Ujjwal! Welcome to my website. <br><br>
        I am a data scientist with 9+ years of work experience. I have worked on projects involving big data analytics, predictive modeling, machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, India in 2013. I like to take part in Kaggle competitions in my free time. <br><br> Feel free to reach out in case you see an opportunity for collaboration!

      <h1>Work Experience</h1>
      <p> <b> 2021 - Present | Gojek Tech | Senior Data Scientist </b> </p>
      <p>
        I am part of the Care Tech team where I use machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing techniques to extract insights and drive automation by analyzing customer service interactions across various channels like email, in-app requests, chat, twitter etc.<br></br>
      </p>

      <p> <b> 2018 - 2021 | American Express | Senior Data Scientist </b> </p>
      <p>
        I was part of the data science team working on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) layer of the AskAmex chatbot. My work involved:
      </p>
      <li>
        Training transformer-based models (like BERT, distilBERT, RoBERTa etc.) for intent classification. I removed label noise from training datasets using various robust machine learning techniques which lead to 5% increase in prediction accuracy.
        <br></br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Building human-in-the-loop (HITL) pipelines for collecting labeled data at a minimal cost. I used weak supervision and active learning strategies to filter relevant data points for annotation. I built various interactive tools to help data labelers work efficiently. I introduced best practices and quality checks in the annotation pipelines to ensure high-quality output.
        <br></br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborating with product teams to improve customer experience. I built interactive tools to visualize the performance of servicing journeys. These tools helped identify the edge cases that often lead to automation failures. I got alignment on tracking additional sentiment level KPIs (apart from automation) to holistically capture the channel performance.
        <br></br>
      </li>

      <p> <b> 2017 - 2018 | American Express | Data Scientist</b></p>
      <p>
        I was part of the data science team working on an offer recommendation engine for the mobile app and website. My work involved:
      </p>
      <li>
        Building factorization machine models to predict click-through rate. I built spark-based feature engineering pipelines to process terabytes of clickstream data for training these models. The models were part of the final stacked ensemble that got deployed in production.
        <br></br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimizing impression caps on offers to drive higher overall engagement on the channel. I built xgboost models to analyse the sensitivity of click-through rate with respect to impressions. I then used the partial dependency plots from these models to identify the impression cap that maximised f-beta score.
        <br></br>
      </li>

      <p> <b> 2015 - 2017 | American Express | Senior Data Analyst</b></p>
      <p>
        I was part of the modeling team working on up-sell, cross-sell targeting via email campaigns. My work involved:
      </p>
      <li>
        Building artificial neural network-based models. These were binary classification models which predicted the probability of an existing customer taking up a more premium product. These models replaced the legacy logistic regression models by delivering better performance while simultaneously driving operational efficiency.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Migrating the legacy data pipelines and feature engineering codes from sas to python to support the deployment of above mentioned neural network models in production. Enabled automater re-training pipelines to solve for data drift.
        <br></br>
      </li>

      <p> <b> 2014 - 2015 | American Express | Data Analyst</b></p>

      <p>
        I joined the customer marketing team focusing on international markets (non-US). I worked on two initiatives:
      </p>
      <li>
        Targeting strategy for dynamic email campaigns in partnership with movable ink. The focus was to increase customer spending on small merchants in the UK. I analyzed transaction data to understand the location and category preferences of the customers. The analysis generated content-based recommendations displayed to the customer via dynamic email. The open and click rates for these campaigns were significantly higher than the long term average.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Joint venture with Gurunavi. Amex partnered with Gurunavi to offer dining recommendations to customers in Japan. I designed customer segments by clustering spending patterns across various industry verticals. The customer segments mapped to different personas, each of which received an exclusive set of restaurant recommendations.
